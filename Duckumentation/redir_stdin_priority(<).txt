For testing purpose, I created 6 files (1.c, 2.c, ... 6.c) containing
their name without the extension. "1" in  1.c, "2" in 2.c, and so on.

--------------------------------------------------
|	
|	$> cat 1.c < 2.c < 3.c 
|	
|	->	1
|	
|--------------------------------------------------
|	
|	$> < 1.c < 2.c cat < 3.c
|	
|	->	3
|	
|--------------------------------------------------
|	
|	$> < 5.c cat < 2.c < 6.c 
|	
|	->	6
|	
|--------------------------------------------------
|	
|	$> < 4.c < 2.c < 6.c cat
|	
|	->	6
|	
--------------------------------------------------

The file used as STDIN is the last that has been redirected, except if cat is the first command,
then it is the one right after on the right.
