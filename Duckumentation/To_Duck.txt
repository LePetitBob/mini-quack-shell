test tricky redir when implemented (echo lol >/dev/full)
cd -> CDPATH

if redir, pb open of fd

see expand_var.c to expand possible env var in HERE_DOC

-if bad redir + cat, pipe of cat fails and doesn't wait for Ctrl+D
THis works so nvm, bash does the same, it doesn't wait

------------------------

Albe :

ENV VAR IN HERE_DOC MUST BE EXPANDED

echo "h ey" > hey| echo hey>hey
- error fd -> check parsing
- make syntax error for ';'
- make syntax error for '&'
- make syntax error for '&&'

// question : - make syntax error for '||' ? Or consider it like an empty pipe ?
	// it is already the case (syntax error)
// logically speaking, i'd rather make the syntax error

- "h ey" hey|<hey -> permission denied

LEAKS :

(dunno :
- "readline")
==> Normal. Comes from readline, no matter what you do.
Just forget about it, as the subject precises that you can just ignore it.

exec :
- Invalid read of size 1
	- get_cmd_str (execution.c:85)
	- relink_parent_to_himself (expand_tokenize.c:64)
- Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
	-close_wait_clear (cmd_manager.c:70)

parsing :
	- expand_caller (expand_manager.c:29)
- Found in -->export "" | unset "" and -->../a.out
	- Definitely lost :
		- ft_del_one (split_separators.c:80)
		- expand_var (expand_var.c:63)
		- ft_strnew (split_quotes_dollar.c:44)
		- ft_tabdup (split_quotes_dollar.c:35)
		- and some more, i'll let you catch them all
			(don't mind those in cd i'll take care of them)
