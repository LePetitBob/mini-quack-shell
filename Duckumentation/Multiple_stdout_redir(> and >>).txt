Pretty simple one, of you add multiple times the "> *file*" sigil, it will
redirect the output to the last file called this way : 

---------------------------------------------------------------
|
|	$> cat 4.c > outfile > /dev/stdout > outfile2
|	$> cat outfile
|	$> cat outfile2
|		->	4
|
---------------------------------------------------------------

If there are >> (append), even if they're mixed up with >, only the last
one will count.
